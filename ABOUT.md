# The Heart of HARem

The name **HARem** is more than just a technical acronym (**H**ome **A**ssistant **Rem**ote); it is an homage to the historical and cultural "inner sanctum" of the household.

## 📛 Naming Inspiration: The Inner Sanctum
In Turkish and Ottoman history, the **Harem** represented the most private, sacred, and protected part of the home. It was the heart of domestic life, managed with absolute privacy and care. 

By adopting this name, the project acknowledges the smart home as the modern individual's "inner sanctum." Just as the historical Harem was the center of the household, this remote serves as the private, primary interface to control and protect the sanctity of your living space.
