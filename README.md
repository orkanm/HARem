# HARem - Home Assistant Remote Controller

**HARem** is a high-performance, minimalist "Thin Client" remote controller designed for the modern smart home. Built on the **ESPHome** ecosystem and powered by the **ESP32-C3**, it provides a boutique-quality physical interface that prioritizes speed, aesthetics, and zero-maintenance operation.

## 📛 The Name
**HARem** is a clever portmanteau of **H**ome **A**ssistant and **Rem**ote. Its inspiration is rooted in Turkish history, representing the "inner sanctum" of the home. See [ABOUT.md](ABOUT.md) for the full story.

## 🏛️ Architecture: The "Thin Client" Philosophy
Unlike traditional smart remotes that require manual configuration of every button, HARem operates as a dynamic viewport into your Home Assistant instance.
- **Service-Driven**: Rooms, devices, and states are streamed in real-time.
- **Zero Maintenance**: New devices added to a Home Assistant Area automatically appear on the remote.
- **Infinite Extensibility**: Complex logic is handled by Home Assistant Blueprints and Automations, keeping the hardware lightweight and responsive.

## ✨ Features
- **Modern UI**: A 5-line OLED interface featuring **Outfit** and **Montserrat** typography.
- **Dynamic Marquee**: Long device names automatically scroll with a smooth marquee effect.
- **Visual Feedback**: Interactive animations for startup, sleep countdowns, and action confirmations.
- **Power Intelligence**: Configurable standby and deep-sleep modes with precise battery voltage monitoring.
- **Global Control**: Toggle animations and power settings directly from a local on-device menu.
